* copyright 2013 Bas Brands. www.sonsbeekmedia.nl
* authors   Bas Brands, David Scotson
* license   http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU GPL v3 or later

This theme has been created with the help of:
Stuart Lamour, Mark Aberdour, Paul Hibbitts, Mary Evans, Joby Harding, Gareth J Barnard

This theme is based on the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework version 3.0.2.
It contains all unmodified less* CSS sources from the Twitter Bootstrap CSS
framework in folder /less/bootstrap.
On top of the Bootstrap less CSS sources Moodle CSS is added to create this
theme.

HTML5 is tags are used in the /layout/general.php file. The structure of this file
provides a 2-1-3 layout when looking at your Moodle page source. This improves
accessibility and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

*less CSS
Less CSS is a Object Oriented way of writing CSS code. All Less CSS files
for this theme are stored in the /less folder. A developer can use recess
to generate the CSS files in the /style folder. For more
information read /less/README

JavaScript Libraries

html5shiv.js
------------
To provide backwards compatibility for HTML5 for Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and Internet
Explorer 8 (IE8) a javascript library call /javascript/html5shiv.js was added. This
JavaScript converts HTML tags and CSS into Tag that are understood by IE7 and IE8.
The config.php makes sure these libraries are only loaded for IE7 and IE8.

bootstrapcollapse.js, bootstrapdropdown.js, bootstrapengine.js
--------------------------------------------------------------
These are the 3 out of 12 original YUI ports of the Twitter Bootstrap jQuery libraries by
Jay Shirley. The full list of the ported libraries can be found here:
https://github.com/jshirley/bootstrap/tree/master/js

moodlebootstrap.js
------------------
This file initiates the bootstrap*.js libraries.

headercollapse.js
-----------------
Workaround for the collapse button on the Moodle custom menu. Without this
Submenu items cannot be opened

Updating Twitter bootstrap and Libraries
========================================

Twitter bootstrap
-----------------
This theme uses the original unmodified version 2.3.0 Twitter bootstrap less files. These are
Object Oriented CSS files. The bootstrap repository is available on:

https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git

To update to the latest release of twitter bootstrap remove all files from less/bootstrap,
download the new less files and store them in less/bootstrap
Inclusion of bootstrap files is configured in less/moodle.less. To generate the new
Moodle CSS read /less/README

html5shiv.js
------------
This theme uses the original unmodified html5shiv.js JavaScript library to enable HTML5 tags in IE7 and IE8.
This library is available on:

https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/blob/master/src/html5shiv.js

To update to the latest release of html5shiv download and replace:
javascript/html5shiv.js

bootstrapcollapse.js, bootstrapdropdown.js, bootstrapengine.js
--------------------------------------------------------------
This them uses YUI ports of the Twitter bootstrap jQuery based libs. These ported files are available on:

https://github.com/jshirley/yui3-gallery/blob/master/src/gallery-bootstrap-collapse/js/bootstrap-collapse.js
https://github.com/jshirley/yui3-gallery/blob/master/src/gallery-bootstrap-dropdown/js/bootstrap-dropdown.js
https://github.com/jshirley/yui3-gallery/blob/master/src/gallery-bootstrap-engine/js/bootstrap-engine.js

The content of these files are slightly modified to make sure all required YUI libraries are loaded. To achieve
that the first and last line of each of these files has been modified.

The YUI port of the Twitter bootstrap libs are now longer maintained. If you need all of the Bootstrap JavaScript
functionality consider switching to the original jQuery version of these file

If you do want to update use these file locations:
javascript/bootstrap-collapse.js
javascript/bootstrap-dropdown.js
javascript/bootstrap-engine.js
